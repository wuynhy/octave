Brainstorming, Conceptualizing Project
Today was a day of introductions and brainstorming. Our group came together, got acquainted, and took some time to understand each other's strengths and areas of interest. We then huddled up and started throwing around ideas for our project. It was an exciting day, full of possibilities. We decided to take a breather, let the ideas percolate, and regroup for further discussion.
