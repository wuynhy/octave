## 06/28

- Today was our first day working on the project. We started by discussing our project and scope and ultimately ended up on a music streaming site. Octave. We did wireframing and started tables and databases.

## 06/30

- We encountered some difficulties while setting up the tables, facing migration history errors. As a result, we had to delete all volumes and containers to resolve the issue.

## 07/06

- I started on back-end endpoints for profiles and friendships. we still had more trouble with tables and migrations.

## 07/11

- Every person in our team worked on their own parts. We had some trouble getting used to FastAPI, but we're getting there. We also had to decide where to keep our music files, and we chose Amazon s3.

## 07/13

- Today, I focused on the CRUD API endpoints specifically for the 'friends' feature. I successfully created functionalities that allow users to send basic friend requests, accept them, and also delete unwanted requests or friendships. Feeling accomplished with the progress made.

## 07/19

- Today, we collaborated on styling the main landing page using Figma. I was surprised at how much we can get done with this app.

## 07/23

- Today, I integrated Redux into our project to help with state management. I also worked on creating a custom music player and set up its respective components. Both tasks went smoothly, and I'm satisfied with the progress made

## 07/26

- Today, we completed the deployment process and ran all unit tests. We also held a group session to review how to check and approve merge requests, as well as how to address any pipeline issues that arise.

## 07/28

- Today, I devoted a good portion of my time to the front-end, specifically the 'friends' tab. I've introduced a new feature in the form of a React component, namely 'FriendsTabComponent', which allows users to see their friends and manage incoming friend requests. This dedicated section in our user interface streamlines the experience, making it easier for users to see and interact with their connections.
